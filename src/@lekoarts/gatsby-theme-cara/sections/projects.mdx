## Trustpoint Is Continuously Improved And Further Developed

Trustpoint's ease of use stands above all technical possibilities for us. Our goal is to make PKI and digital identities as easy to use as possible.

### Beta Release V0.1.0 - 11/2024

- Trustpoint Stack as a web-based application – introduced the foundational Trustpoint platform accessible via web interface.
- User-Driven Onboarding – implemented guided onboarding workflows for users to register and enroll devices or credentials.
- Trustpoint Client – added client-side tooling for certificate enrollment and management.
- Browser-Based Onboarding – enabled users to perform onboarding directly through a web browser.
- Local Issuing CA – provided built-in certificate authority functionality for issuing and managing local certificates.
- Trust Store Management – introduced management of trusted root and issuing certificates.
- Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) Endpoint – implemented CMP endpoint for standard-based certificate enrollment.
- Published under MIT License – made the project open source under the MIT license.

### Beta Release V0.2.0 - 3/2025

- Setup wizard & improved onboarding – introduced an initial setup assistant and streamlined onboarding workflows for easier first-time configuration.
- Remote credential download (browser onboarding) – enabled users to securely download credentials directly via the browser onboarding process.
- Credential revocation (CRL) & security fixes – added certificate revocation list generation and multiple security-related improvements.
- Major code & onboarding refactor – significant restructuring of onboarding logic and core components for stability and maintainability.
- Docker & startup improvements; moved to uv – optimized container startup, reduced image complexity, and transitioned to the uv runtime for better performance.
- Enhanced testing & demo data – expanded test coverage, added demo datasets, PostgreSQL support, and new signature suites for testing.
- Key dependency updates – upgraded to Django 5.1.5, cryptography v44, and other critical libraries for compatibility and security.
- Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) endpoint – introduced EST support as an additional enrollment method.

### Beta Release V0.3.0 - 9/2025

- Stabilisation and code quality improvements – addressing linting, typing (Ruff, MyPy), imports, documentation and overall maintainability.
- Docker/Deployment/CI improvements – ensuring smoother container orchestration, compose actions, manual builds and versioning.
- Backup and restore support for Docker environments enables reliable configuration migration and updates.
- Feature enhancements/bug fixes, including OPC UA GDS support, certificate model updates, UI fixes and domain relation improvements.
- CycloneDX and SPDX SBOMs: Trustpoint now provides a software bill of materials for improved transparency and compliance.
- Notifications have been refactored to provide more structured notifications, enhanced help/support views and UI fixes in management, settings and logging.
- Zero-touch onboarding with AOKI: added support for EST and CMP to enable automated onboarding.
- Granular protocol enabling per device allows finer control of enabled protocols.
- Auto-generation of local root CA and issuing CA simplifies setup and testing.
- Docker and GitHub Actions/workflows have been improved to enhance build, tagging and manual compose processes.
- Improved help pages for certificate lifecycle management – clearer guidance and documentation for issuing and renewing certificates.

## Pipeline Features

- **RESTful API** – provides full programmatic access for integrating Trustpoint with external systems and automation workflows.
- **PKCS#11 Support** – enables secure key storage and cryptographic operations using hardware security modules (HSMs).
- **Signing Authority (Hash and Sign)** – introduces a service for external signing requests, supporting hash-and-sign operations.
- **Workflow Engine** – adds customizable workflows with E-Mail notifications and webhook integrations for event-driven automation.
- **Registration Authority (RA) Functionality** – extends Trustpoint to operate as a dedicated RA for validation and approval processes.
- **Enhanced CMP Functionalities** – adds support for certificate revocation, extended request handling, and compliance with RFC standards.
- **Refactored Request Workflow** – unifies and improves handling of CMP, EST, and REST requests for better reliability and scalability.
- **Certificate Profile Engine** – introduces standardized certificate profiles with flexible adaptation options for different PKI environments.
