## Initiative & Background

The Trustpoint research project has been funded by the German Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space since September 2023. The aim of the project is to develop an open source solution that ensures the secure provision of digital certificates in industrial networks and their management throughout their entire life cycle. Trustpoint helps companies to verify chains of trust. This makes it easier and better to secure machines and their components in factories.

## Development Team

The Trustpoint development team consists of medium-sized companies (achelos, asvin, Keyfactor) with expertise in the field of security as well as research institutes and universities (Campus Schwarzwald, Hamm-Lippstadt University of Applied Sciences).

The practical relevance to the user is ensured by the close exchange with our associated partners ARBURG, Belden Inc, HOMAG, Phoenix Contact, Schmalz, Siemens and Diebold Nixdorf.
