Create a clean cartoon/comic avatar of the SAME PERSON from the reference photo. Likeness is the top priority: keep the face looking like the real person. Preserve identity-critical features exactly: - facial proportions and face shape (jawline, cheeks, chin) - hairline and hairstyle - eyebrows, eye shape/spacing, nose shape, lip shape, smile - skin tone - any existing facial hair exactly as in the photo (beard/stubble/moustache or none) - glasses exactly as in the photo (shape, thickness, color) or none Do NOT add any details not present in the photo: no new facial hair, no new glasses, no extra accessories, no new wrinkles/freckles/scars, no age change. Style: semi-realistic cartoon (low exaggeration, 0–5%); clean lines, smooth flat colors with subtle 2–3 tone shading; no skin pores/photorealistic texture. Crop: face-only avatar (head + a little neck, no shoulders/torso). Background: plain neutral gray (#8f8f8f) with rounded-square framing. Expression: match the reference photo.
